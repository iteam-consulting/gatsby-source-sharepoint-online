# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project! :tada:

## Pull Requests

All code contributions are added via Pull Requests. If you are working on an issue, please create a branch in your fork with a sensible name (probably which describes the issue(s) you are fixing). You can create a PR immediately and mark it as [Draft](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/). Once your changes are complete, you should mark your PR as ready for review.

We operate with a `master <- feature` branch pattern.

## Testing

This project has 2 testing layers: unit and e2e. We use [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing and [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for e2e testing. If you want to help us fix bugs or add new features, please make sure you include unit (and if necessary, e2e) testing with your code contributions.
